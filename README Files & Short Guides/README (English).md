## Installation

1. Open the `release` folder.
2. Run the latest installer, for example `File Converter Pro Setup 1.0.2.exe`.
3. Follow the Windows installation steps.
4. Launch the app from the Start menu or shortcut.

Use the complete `.exe` installer. A `.blockmap` file and a `.__uninstaller.exe` file are not installers.
After installation, Windows creates a desktop shortcut. The app starts automatically in borderless fullscreen mode. The installed files are stored locally in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\bestandsconverter`.

## Using the app

1. Add files with `Browse Files` or a folder with `Browse Folder`.
2. You can also drag files into the window.
3. Select an output format and, if needed, a resolution for each file.
4. Use bulk actions when processing multiple files.
5. Select `Convert All`.
6. Download results individually or as a ZIP archive.

When an output folder is configured in Settings, individual downloads and ZIP archives are saved there automatically without opening the Windows save dialog. Without an output folder, Windows asks where each download should be saved.

### Audio transcription

1. Add a WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG or another supported audio file.
2. Select `TXT` for plain text or `SRT` for subtitles.
3. Select `Convert All` and wait for the transcription to finish.
4. Download the generated transcript.

Transcription runs locally with the Whisper engine included in the installer. No MSYS2, separate Whisper installation or internet connection is required. WAV files are normalized automatically before transcription.

Conversions can run without an output folder. Source files are only deleted automatically when an output folder is configured and the converted file has been saved there successfully.

For the best result, use a valid source file, a suitable output format and an appropriate resolution. Large media files may take longer to process.

## GPU acceleration

The app checks the installed video adapter at startup. If only an integrated GPU is detected, Electron hardware acceleration is disabled. With a dedicated GPU, it remains enabled. NVIDIA GPUs can use `h264_nvenc` and AMD GPUs can use `h264_amf` for supported video output. Audio is processed natively through FFmpeg.

## Shortcuts

- `F11`: toggle fullscreen

The Electron menu bar is hidden. The app starts in borderless fullscreen mode.

## Set a background

Click the gear icon next to the light/dark toggle on the home page. Choose `Add background` or `Change background` and select an image. Choose `Turn background off` to return to the default background. The choice is stored locally in `config.json` and checked on every startup. Use an image with the same aspect ratio as your screen, otherwise the background may be stretched.

## First run

On the first launch, the user chooses a language. A short guide then appears in that language. The selection is stored locally and the guide is not shown again.

## Development

Requirements: Windows 10 or later, Node.js 18 or later and npm.

```powershell
npm install
npm rebuild ffmpeg-static --foreground-scripts
npm run dev
```

Other commands:

```powershell
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dist
```

The installer is created at `release/File Converter Pro Setup <version>.exe`.

## Libraries

- React and React DOM: user interface
- TypeScript and Vite: development and builds
- Electron: desktop runtime
- electron-builder: Windows installer
- FFmpeg and `ffmpeg-static`: video and audio conversion
- PDF.js and jsPDF: reading and creating PDFs
- FFmpeg: HEIC/AVIF support
- ImageTracerJS: SVG conversion
- zip.js: ZIP archives and AES-256 encryption
- Tailwind CSS, PostCSS and Autoprefixer: styling
- `concurrently`: starts Vite and Electron together

## Technology and privacy

The renderer uses `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`. Native functionality is exposed through the limited preload IPC API. Conversion is performed locally. Internet access is only required for the initial npm installation.
